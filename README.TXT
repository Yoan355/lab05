TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.

This project aims to implements a technical support system for customers of 
the DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

This project is only a first, rudimentary step towards the full solution.


////////////////////AWNSERS TO QUESTIONS/////////////////////

24: A HashMap is a data structure that stores information in key-value pairs.It stores data
using a key and value.It helps us find the values much faster with the key.

25: A Key-related methods (K):
 get(Object key)
 remove(Object key)
 containsKey(Object key)
 keySet()
 put(K key, V value)


Value-related methods (V):
 containsValue(Object value)
values()
replace(K key, V value)
Yes, you can use the same type for both key and value.


26:  size() returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.
